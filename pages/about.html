   <p>Our dream has always been to have a large yard where we could grow beauty and improve the land. When we purchased our first home in 2008 in Kennewick, WA, we had to sacrifice on this dream
   to buy the home that worked best for our family at the time. We loved that little yard, though. We filled it will flowers, trees and a pretty big garden. We were content there - we 
   thought we'd be there 
   forever.  Then came a new opportunity.  We were moving to Provo, Utah. I was so sad to leave all those mature plants I had worked so hard to cultivate over the years. 
   But now we had a new chance to find the yard of our dreams. The search for a home in our new location was quite a challenge. The market was hot, and homes were
   selling before they hit the market. Most of the homes we looked at did not have large yards. The first home we put on 
   offer on had a lot smaller than the one we were coming from. But then an opportunity arose.  A house with just over 3/4 of an acre on the 
   east bench in Provo. 
   It was more than we were hoping to spend, but the yard really sold us on it. I began my search for what beautiful flowers I could add the the currently barren yard. In my search I came across Floret Flower, and bought "A Cut Flower Garden" looking
   for ideas of fun things to plant. I had a list a mile long of all the beautiful varieties I wanted to try out here. When we moved in, we mdae a few
   discovries. Deer were everpresent, and love to much on most flowers and plants. The yard was was laden with weeds. What had apeared to be green grass in the 
   listing photos was mothing more than yarrow, crabgrass and clover. And the more we looked, the more we found. The areas without noticiable plants
   were covered in puncturvine - the seed of which
   is the dreaded goathead.  There were millions of those goathead seeds all over our property. I began to wonder what we were thinking trying to cultivate this clay based weed magnet of a yard.
   Each time I spotted a weed, I'd google the best way to remove it, and the answer was always bad news. Horsetail, cheetgrass, puncturvine and yarrow are not easy to 
   stop. But we had some ideas. We had made friends with a local arborist who promised to give us truck loads of woodchips. It was somewhere in that 
   Cut Garden book I learned about using cardboard as a weed barrier.  So we started collecting boxes making a plan. We decided to go all in and put a fence around the backyard 
   to give our garden and orchard a shot against the deer.  Through the end of winter and early spring, we spent weekend after weekend laying cardboard and covering 
   it with wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow of various woodchips.  More than 10 dumptruck loads of woodchips!  We added a shed to the only improved spot in the far backyard - a simple 10X20 concrete pad, 
   which had some electrical wiring near by.  This would be our future potting shed and workshop. In March we planted over 20 trees, which included 17 different varieties of 
   fruit trees. We constructed our garden beds for the veggie patch, and added a garden fence to keep the dog and future chickens out. Little by little the yard
   that felt overwhelming and hopeless began to take shape.  </p>
